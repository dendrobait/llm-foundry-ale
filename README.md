# LLM Foundry

LLM Foundry is the source repository for the development of models, datasets, and accompanying artifacts of the **Polyglot** project at the University of Bonn. It bundles training, evaluation, post-training, data processing, and tokenization pipelines into a single, cluster-ready code base.

## Overview

This repository contains all source code used for the development of the models, datasets, and all other accompanying artifacts tied to the Polyglot project at the University of Bonn. It is designed to run on the [Marvin cluster](https://www.hpc.uni-bonn.de/) (University of Bonn), which has a dual software stack (AMD and Intel) that the code base is aware of.

## Repository Structure

The code base is organized into the following main folders:

- [`alignment/`](alignment/) — Implementation of post-training techniques for alignment, including both Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Reward Model training, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with verifier-based rewards.
  - [`alignment/gym/`](alignment/gym/) — Scripts for training and evaluating language models on custom environments.
- [`data/`](data/) — Scripts for working with text preprocessing (i.e., filtering, tokenization, etc.).
  - [`data/cc/`](data/cc/) — Scripts for working with Common Crawl data.
  - [`data/filters/`](data/filters/) — Dataset filtering and annotation pipelines for text corpus curation.
  - [`data/tokenization/`](data/tokenization/) — Tokenization, packing, decontamination, and validation split utilities for pretraining and SFT datasets.
- [`distributed/`](distributed/) — Scripts for training and evaluating language models with DDP and FSDP.
- [`evals/`](evals/) — Scripts for evaluating language models via the `lm-evaluation-harness`.
- [`merge/`](merge/) — Scripts for running different merging techniques via `mergekit`.
- [`synthetic/`](synthetic/) — Scripts for generating synthetic datasets with vLLM.
- [`tests/`](tests/) — Unit and integration tests for our code base.
- [`tokenizer/`](tokenizer/) — Scripts for training and evaluating tokenizers.
- [`utils/`](utils/) — Miscellaneous utilities for our code base.

## Installation

All of our codebase is designed to run on the Marvin cluster (University of Bonn). You will only need to set things up on the cluster itself - not on your local machine. For your local machine, you can just clone the repository and work with the files (e.g., editing code, writing new scripts, etc.) without worrying too much about dual stack setups or module loading.

### Workspace Setup on Marvin

Use [`utils/marvin_create_workspace.sh`](utils/marvin_create_workspace.sh) to allocate a workspace, clone the repository, and prepare the directory layout. Open the script first and edit the user customization section at the top (`username`, `file_system`, `work_group`, `email`, `workspace_name`) to match your account, then run it from a Marvin login node:

```bash
bash utils/marvin_create_workspace.sh
```

The script also contains commented step-by-step instructions for creating the per-config virtual environments (`.venv_data,` `.venv_distributed`, `.venv_synth`, `.venv_trl`) and submitting the pip install jobs to the right partition.

### Module Stack Selection

Marvin has a dual software stack (AMD and Intel). The single [`.modules.sh`](.modules.sh) file at the repository root loads the right one for you. It auto-detects the stack from the SLURM environment, so most of the time you just source it and forget about it:

```bash
# Inside a SLURM job: auto-detected from #SBATCH directives
#   - GPU job (--gres=gpu:...)             -> AMD
#   - partition name contains "gpu"        -> AMD
#   - any other partition                  -> Intel
source "$workdir/.modules.sh"
```

On a login node, there is no SLURM context, so you must force the stack explicitly when creating venvs or running ad-hoc commands:

```bash
LLM_FOUNDRY_STACK=amd   source "$workdir/.modules.sh"   # GPU/training stack
LLM_FOUNDRY_STACK=intel source "$workdir/.modules.sh"   # CPU/data stack
```

Sourcing prints whose stack was selected, why, and the resulting module list, so your job logs always show the resolved environment.

### Installing Dependencies

Use the [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/Polygl0t/llm-foundry/blob/main/pyproject.toml) to install a specific set of dependencies. The available extras are:

* `data` — For downloading and preprocessing datasets.  
* `distributed` — For training language models with our DDP and FSDP implementations.  
* `synth` — For generating synthetic samples with vLLM.  
* `trl` — For post-training and alignment with TRL.  
* `tests` — For running our test suite.  

For example:

```bash
pip install -e "./llm-foundry/.[distributed]"  # for DDP/FSDP training
```

## Running the Tests

Install the test dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -e "./llm-foundry/.[tests]"
```

Run all test scripts in sequence:

```bash
python tests/
```

Or run a specific script (e.g., the distributed training tests):

```bash
python tests/tests_distributed.py
```
